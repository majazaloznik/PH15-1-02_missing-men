OK, so I need to map a world map, and do so with as little fuss as possible. 

i need both mapping data, as well as a mapping package

1. mapping data:

`rnaturalearth` seems to be one source. using countires 110 has 177 polygons and same number of names.

`worldmap` is another data package i think, but seems to be based on rnaturalearth anyway? Hmm, so using worldmap::countriesCoarse has 243 polygons, and 202 country names
